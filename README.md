# NixOS configuration

This is my personal configuration for NixOS. I will most likely split this to multiple repositories or
branches for my server/workstation/other... I've also tried writing up a small tutorial for my first
installation of NixOS. See the [Manual](#Manual) section if this is your first time installing NixOS.

# Manual

## 1. Installation

## 2. First login

## 3.1 Setting up git and github
